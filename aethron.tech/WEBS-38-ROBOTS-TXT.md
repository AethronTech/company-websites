# WEBS-38: Enhanced Robots.txt Implementation

## Overview
Updated and enhanced the robots.txt file for the Aethron Technologies website to provide better SEO guidance for search engine crawlers.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced Robots.txt Features
1. **Company Branding**: Added Aethron Technologies header with last updated date
2. **Improved Organization**: Better structured with clear sections and comments
3. **Enhanced Path Management**:
   - Disallow development and admin paths (`/admin/`, `/private/`, `/_site/`, `/node_modules/`, `/.git/`)
   - Disallow demo and test pages (`/webs-37-demo/`, `/seo-example/`, `/test-*`)
   - Allow important asset directories (`/assets/`, `/images/`, `/css/`, `/js/`)
4. **Multi-language Support**: Explicit allow rules for both English (`/`) and Dutch (`/nl/`) content
5. **Search Engine Specific Rules**: Added specific rules for major search engines (Googlebot, Bingbot)
6. **Sitemap Reference**: Properly references the sitemap.xml location
7. **Crawl Rate Control**: Set crawl-delay to 1 second for respectful crawling

### File Structure
- **Location**: `/src/robots.njk`
- **Output**: `/robots.txt` (at domain root)
- **Template**: Uses Eleventy's template system for dynamic URL generation

## Implementation Details

### Template Configuration
```yaml
---
permalink: /robots.txt
eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true
---
```

### Key Directives
- `User-agent: *` - Rules for all crawlers
- `Allow: /` - Allow crawling of main content
- `Disallow: /admin/` - Block admin areas
- `Sitemap: {{site.url}}/sitemap.xml` - Dynamic sitemap reference
- `Crawl-delay: 1` - Respectful crawling rate

## SEO Benefits
1. **Better Crawl Efficiency**: Guides crawlers to important content while avoiding unnecessary paths
2. **Multi-language Support**: Ensures both English and Dutch content is properly indexed
3. **Asset Optimization**: Allows crawling of important assets while blocking development files
4. **Sitemap Integration**: Direct reference to XML sitemap for comprehensive site discovery

## Testing
- Builds successfully with `npm run build`
- Generates clean robots.txt at domain root
- Maintains proper URL structure for production deployment

## Future Considerations
- Monitor crawl behavior in search console
- Adjust crawl-delay based on server performance
- Add/remove paths as site structure evolves
- Consider adding rules for specific social media crawlers if needed
