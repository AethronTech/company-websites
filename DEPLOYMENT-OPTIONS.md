# Deployment Strategy & CI/CD Options

## 🚀 **Current Situation**
- Netlify auto-deploy not available for GitHub organization (paid feature)
- Need efficient CI/CD with quality checks
- Want deployment automation where possible

## 📋 **Recommended Options**

### **Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended) 🌟**

**Setup:**
1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. Use the `github-pages.yml` workflow (already created)
3. Deploy automatically when pushing to `main`

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Completely free**
- ✅ **Automatic deployment** from main branch
- ✅ **Custom domain support** (aethron.tech)
- ✅ **HTTPS by default**
- ✅ **CDN included**
- ✅ **No manual steps** needed

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ **Public repository required** (but your site is public anyway)
- ⚠️ **GitHub Pages limitations** (static sites only - which you have)

**Workflow:**
```
dev branch → merge to main → automatic GitHub Pages deployment
```

### **Option 2: Manual Netlify Deployment 📁**

**Setup:**
1. Use the `build-for-deployment.yml` workflow (already created)
2. Download build artifacts from GitHub Actions
3. Upload to Netlify manually or via CLI

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Keep Netlify features** (forms, redirects, etc.)
- ✅ **Full control** over deployment timing
- ✅ **Quality checks** still automated

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ **Manual deployment step** required
- ⚠️ **More complex** workflow

**Workflow:**
```
main branch → GitHub builds → download artifact → upload to Netlify
```

### **Option 3: Netlify CLI Automation 🔧**

**Setup:**
1. Add Netlify auth token to GitHub secrets
2. Modify workflow to deploy via Netlify CLI
3. Automatic deployment with quality gates

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Fully automated**
- ✅ **Keep Netlify features**
- ✅ **Quality gates included**

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ **Requires Netlify auth token** management
- ⚠️ **More complex** setup

## 🎯 **My Recommendation: GitHub Pages**

Given your constraints, **GitHub Pages is the best option** because:

1. **Zero cost** and zero ongoing management
2. **Automatic deployment** - no manual steps
3. **Perfect for your static site**
4. **Custom domain support** for aethron.tech
5. **All current quality checks** still work

### **Migration Steps:**

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings:
   - Source: "GitHub Actions" 
   - Custom domain: "aethron.tech"

2. **Update workflow** (already done):
   - `github-pages.yml` handles automatic deployment

3. **Simplified CI/CD**:
   - `build.yml` - Quality checks on dev/main
   - `github-pages.yml` - Auto-deploy main to GitHub Pages
   - Remove complex `deploy.yml`

4. **DNS Setup**:
   - Point aethron.tech to GitHub Pages
   - CNAME: `<username>.github.io`

### **Quality Assurance Maintained:**
- ✅ All linting (JS, HTML, CSS)
- ✅ Lighthouse performance checks  
- ✅ Pa11y accessibility audits
- ✅ OG validation (WEBS-49)
- ✅ Build verification
- ✅ Only deploys when all checks pass

## 🤔 **Your Choice**

Which option would you prefer? I can:

1. **Set up GitHub Pages** (recommended - fully automated, free)
2. **Set up manual Netlify** workflow (build artifacts for manual upload)
3. **Set up Netlify CLI** automation (requires auth token setup)

Let me know your preference and I'll implement it!
